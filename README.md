"The Evolution of Action Movies: From Explosions to Animation"


In the early 1980s, action movies were all the rage. Films like "Die Hard" (1988) and "Terminator" (1984) dominated the box office, with their high-octane action sequences, memorable one-liners, and charismatic leads. These films were made on relatively modest budgets, with "Die Hard" costing around $28 million and "Terminator" costing around $6.4 million.

As the decades passed, the action movie genre continued to evolve. The 1990s saw the rise of martial arts films, with movies like "Rush Hour" (1998) and "Enter the Dragon" (1993) showcasing impressive fight choreography. These films had slightly higher budgets, with "Rush Hour" costing around $33 million and so on.
This Project aims to showcase the trends in production of movies, budget and Revenue, and the popularity of directors of the different movies alike. To uncover the patterns and revenue gotten within the data and the growth of the impact of the movies and the directors alike and the popularity globally in order to provide valuable insight for movie lovers like myself and industry experts. Sit back and journey with me as we explore these data.
